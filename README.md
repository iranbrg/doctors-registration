## Project Progress

In the `main` branch, one can use the stable version of this API whereas in the
`staging` branch are the latest and more updated features.

The `main` is deployed on Digital Ocean and the `staging` branch
is deployed on Heroku. Any client can consume this API.

PS: The deploy to Digital Ocean is only simulated on CI/CD pipeline with Github
Actions. If I actually deployed this project I'd pay 5 dolars/month and I don't
want to spend this money ðŸ˜„. However the `staging` branch is in fact deployed to
Heroku because it's free.
